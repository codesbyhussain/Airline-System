# Airline-System
C++ code that allows managing of flights from an admin terminal. Allows adding and deleting flights, booking, and cancellation with history of customers as well as reward points system

Basic file handling, polymorphism, classes and objects managed in this fully functional project.
The only caveat is that it fire up from the terminal, so if possible gotta work on building a GUI for all of it, otherwise the display is made using gotoxy() several times
to make it look as visually pleasing as possible
