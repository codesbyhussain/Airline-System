# Airline-System
C++ code that allows managing of flights from an admin terminal. Allows adding and deleting flights, booking, and cancellation with history of customers as well as reward points system

Basic file handling, polymorphism, classes and objects managed in this fully functional project.
The only caveat is that it fire up from the terminal, so if possible gotta work on building a GUI for all of it, otherwise the display is made using gotoxy() several times to make it look as visually pleasing as possible.

Additionally, the code is built on Turbo C++, as a mingw compilation. Which is why it might have issues launching on a traditional C++ linux system.

Initial development was done on Borlands C++ back in 2017. I recreated it in 2024 using msys2 to install mingw. You can follow the guide on wikihow to install the software: https://www.wikihow.com/Compile-CPP-File-to-EXE
